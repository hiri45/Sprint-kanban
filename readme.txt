Changes made to Project Management Plan:
- Whilst trello was the main tool used for task tracking and time logging it has been removed and replaced with Jira
- instead of allocating another member to assist with a task if one is struggling the Scrum Master would now break down a task into
  smaller subtasks so that there all members are still assigned to their own tasks
- instead of using google docs to record data all the data will be stored within Jira with google docs only used as a reference to 
  the Project Management Plan and any other information which is stored there
